# Version Control System (VCS) Hosting Platforms

This README provides a brief overview of three popular VCS hosting platforms: GitLab, GitHub, and Bitbucket. Each platform offers robust features for hosting and managing Git repositories, but they have distinct differences.

## GitLab

[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is a web-based platform for Git repository management, continuous integration, and more. Key features include:

- **Git Repository Hosting**: GitLab provides hosting for Git repositories, allowing you to store and manage your source code.

- **CI/CD Integration**: Built-in Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools for automated testing and deployment.

- **Built-In Issue Tracking**: An issue tracking system helps manage tasks, bugs, and feature requests within the same platform.

- **Wikis and Documentation**: Integrated wiki functionality and robust documentation features.

- **Self-Hosted Option**: GitLab offers a self-hosted version that can be installed on your own servers.

## GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is one of the most popular VCS hosting platforms. It offers:

- **Git Repository Hosting**: GitHub is known for its repository hosting services, making it easy to collaborate on open-source projects.

- **Pull Requests**: A robust pull request system for code review and collaboration.

- **Actions**: CI/CD through GitHub Actions, allowing you to automate workflows.

- **Issue Tracking**: A built-in issue tracking system to manage project tasks.

- **GitHub Pages**: A feature for hosting documentation and websites directly from your repositories.

## Bitbucket

[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) is a platform from Atlassian that supports both Git and Mercurial. Key features include:

- **Git and Mercurial Support**: Bitbucket is one of the few platforms supporting both Git and Mercurial.

- **Code Collaboration**: Tools for code collaboration, including pull requests and code reviews.

- **CI/CD Integration**: Integration with CI/CD services like Bitbucket Pipelines.

- **Jira Integration**: Seamless integration with Atlassian's Jira for issue tracking.

- **Repository Permissions**: Fine-grained repository permissions and access control.
