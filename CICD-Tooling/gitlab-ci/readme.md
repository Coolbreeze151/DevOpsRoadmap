# README: GitLab CI/CD Runners and Example Configuration

## Overview

GitLab CI/CD provides a powerful platform for automating the testing and deployment of your software projects. The execution of jobs and pipelines is performed by runners, which can be either shared runners provided by GitLab or specific runners installed on your infrastructure.

## How GitLab CI/CD Runners Work

1. **Runners**: Runners are agents responsible for running jobs defined in `.gitlab-ci.yaml` files. They can be shared runners provided by GitLab or specific runners configured for your projects.

2. **Pipelines**: A pipeline is a series of jobs defined in a `.gitlab-ci.yaml` file. Each job represents a stage in the CI/CD process.

3. **Jobs**: Jobs are individual tasks defined within a pipeline. They can include build, test, deploy, or any custom task you want to automate.

4. **Configuration**: The configuration for CI/CD is defined in a file named `.gitlab-ci.yaml` placed in the root of your repository. This YAML file specifies how jobs are organized and executed.

## Using the Provided `gitlab-ci.yaml` as an Example

The provided `gitlab-ci.yaml` file is an example configuration for a simple CI/CD pipeline. It includes the following stages:

- **build**: Builds the application.
- **test**: Runs tests for the application.
- **deploy**: Deploys the application to a staging environment.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have a valid GitLab CI/CD runner installed and configured on your infrastructure.
- Update the `tags` in the `gitlab-ci.yaml` file to match the tags associated with your registered runner.

### Steps

1. **Copy the YAML File**:

   Copy the provided `gitlab-ci.yaml` file to the root of your GitLab repository.

2. **Customize Configuration**:

   - Modify the stages and jobs to fit your project requirements.
   - Update the `script` section within each job to include the actual commands to build, test, or deploy your application.

3. **Commit and Push**:

   Commit the changes to your repository and push them to GitLab. This will trigger the CI/CD pipeline based on the configuration in the `.gitlab-ci.yaml` file.

4. **Monitor the Pipeline**:

   Visit your project on GitLab, navigate to "CI/CD > Pipelines," and monitor the progress of your pipeline. You can view detailed logs for each job.
