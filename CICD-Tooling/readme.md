# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Tooling

This repository leverages CI/CD tools for automated workflows to enhance development, testing, and deployment processes. Below are the key CI/CD tools used:

## 1. GitHub Actions

[GitHub Actions](github-actions/readme.md) is a powerful CI/CD and automation platform provided by GitHub. It allows you to define workflows using YAML syntax directly in your repository. These workflows can include tasks such as building, testing, and deploying your code. GitHub Actions provides flexibility and seamless integration with your GitHub repositories.

For detailed information on setting up and configuring GitHub Actions, refer to the [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

## 2. GitLab CI/CD

[GitLab CI/CD](gitlab-ci/readme.md) is an integrated CI/CD service provided by GitLab. It allows you to define pipelines using a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, enabling automated testing, building, and deployment of your code. GitLab CI/CD is tightly integrated with GitLab repositories, providing a seamless experience for managing your CI/CD workflows.

For a comprehensive guide on using GitLab CI/CD, refer to the [GitLab CI/CD Documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/).
