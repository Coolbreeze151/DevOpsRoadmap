# GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation and CI/CD platform provided by GitHub, allowing you to build, test, and deploy your projects right from your repository. It's a fantastic way to automate your workflows and integrate with your codebase seamlessly.

For detailed information and documentation on GitHub Actions, visit the [official GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

## Workflows in this Repository

### 1. `commit-success-check.yml`

- This workflow automates a simple file creation and a successful commit to the repository.

### 2. `dependency-check.yml`
