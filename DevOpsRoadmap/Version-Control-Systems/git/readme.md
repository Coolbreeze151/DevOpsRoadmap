## 1. Git Basics

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their codebase over time. Key concepts include:
- **Repository**: A directory or folder that contains your project and its history.
  ```shell
  git init
  ```
- **Commit**: A snapshot of the changes made to the code at a specific point in time.
    ```shell
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    ```
- **Working Directory**: The directory where you make changes to your code.
- **Staging Area**: A place to prepare changes before committing them.
    ```shell
    git add <file(s)>
    git reset <file(s)>
    ```

## 2. Version Control

Version control allows developers to:
- Keep track of changes made to code.
    ``` shell
    git log
    ```
- Collaborate with others by sharing and merging code.
    ``` shell
    git pull
    ```
- Roll back to previous versions in case of issues.
    ```
    git checkout <commit-hash>
    ```

## 3. Branching and Merging

Branching and merging are crucial for managing multiple lines of development. Key concepts include:
- **Branch**: A separate line of development that allows you to work on features or fixes without affecting the main code.
    ``` shell
    git branch <branch-name>
    git checkout <branch-name>
    ```
- **Merge**: Combining changes from one branch into another, often used to integrate new features.
    ``` shell
    git merge <branch-name>
    ```

## 4. Remote Repositories

Remote repositories enable collaboration with others. Key concepts include:
- **Clone**: Create a local copy of a remote repository.
    ``` shell
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
- **Pull**: Retrieve changes from a remote repository.
    ``` shell
    git pull
    ```
- **Push**: Send changes to a remote repository.
    ``` shell
    git push
    ```
- **Fork**: Create a personal copy of a repository to contribute to open-source projects.
