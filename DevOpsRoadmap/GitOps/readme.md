## GitOps

This document provides an introduction to GitOps, a popular approach for managing Kubernetes deployments using Git as the single source of truth. 

### What is GitOps?

GitOps leverages Git for managing infrastructure and applications on Kubernetes.  Configuration files stored in a Git repository define the desired state of your deployments. A GitOps tool watches for changes in the repository and automatically applies them to your Kubernetes cluster, ensuring your cluster reflects the state defined in Git.

GitOps offers several advantages:

* **Version control:** Track changes to your infrastructure and applications using Git version control. 
* **Declarative configuration:** Define the desired state rather than the specific commands to achieve it. 
* **Rollback capability:** Easily rollback deployments by reverting to previous Git commits.
* **Auditability:** Track changes made to your infrastructure through Git history.

### Popular GitOps Tools

Two popular GitOps tools are ArgoCD and FluxCD. Here's a detailed comparison to help you choose the right tool for your needs:

### ArgoCD 

ArgoCD documentation: [https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

ArgoCD is a declarative GitOps continuous delivery (CD) tool for Kubernetes.  It provides a web interface and CLI for managing your Git repository and applying deployments to your Kubernetes cluster. ArgoCD offers the following features:

* **Application definition:** Define applications using YAML manifests or Helm charts stored in your Git repository.
* **Automatic synchronization:** ArgoCD watches your Git repository and automatically synchronizes changes to your Kubernetes cluster.
* **Rollbacks:** Easily rollback deployments by pointing ArgoCD to a previous Git commit.
* **Multi-cluster support:** Deploy applications to multiple Kubernetes clusters from a single Git repository.
* **RBAC integration:** Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) for managing deployments.



### FluxCD

FluxCD documentation: [https://fluxcd.io/flux/migration/](https://fluxcd.io/flux/migration/)

FluxCD is another popular GitOps tool that provides continuous delivery for Kubernetes.  It takes a different approach compared to ArgoCD. FluxCD uses Git controllers running on your cluster to watch your Git repository and apply changes. Here's a breakdown of FluxCD's functionalities:

* **GitOps controllers:** Flux deploys controllers like GitRepository, HelmRelease, and Kustomization resources to your cluster. These controllers watch your Git repository and trigger deployments based on changes. 
* **Declarative configuration:** Define deployments using YAML manifests, Helm charts, or Kustomize in your Git repository.
* **Automatic reconciliation:** Flux controllers continuously reconcile the desired state defined in Git with the actual state of your cluster.
* **Multi-cluster support:** Manage deployments across multiple Kubernetes clusters from a central Git repository.
* **Declarative overrides:** Apply environment-specific configurations using GitOps principles.


### Choosing the Right GitOps Tool

Here's a comparison table to help you decide between ArgoCD and FluxCD:

| Feature                 | ArgoCD                                 | FluxCD                                         |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Deployment approach      | Pull-based (applications trigger sync)   | Push-based (controllers watch for changes)      |
| Configuration             | YAML manifests, Helm charts            | YAML manifests, Helm charts, Kustomize          |
| Web interface            | Yes                                      | No (but integrates with other tools)           |
| Multi-cluster support     | Yes                                      | Yes                                              |
| RBAC integration         | Yes                                      | Requires external tools (e.g., KubeRBAC)           |


**ArgoCD** is a good choice if you prefer a user-friendly web interface, automatic synchronization, and RBAC integration.

**FluxCD** offers a more lightweight and declarative approach using GitOps controllers. It might be preferable if you favor a more Kubernetes-native solution and are comfortable managing deployments through Git and controllers.
